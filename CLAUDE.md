## Project Type

This is a **library-first** crate. There is an examples/ folder buildable binaries
`Cargo.lock` is gitignored per Cargo convention for libraries.

## `#[non_exhaustive]` Policy

All public enums and public structs **with public fields** have
`#[non_exhaustive]`. Structs with all-private fields do **not** need
`#[non_exhaustive]` — privacy already prevents external construction and
destructuring, and omitting the attribute lets internal code benefit from
exhaustive compiler checks.

**Public fields split:** Types with invariants or builder APIs
(`ExecuteOptions`, `EslConnectOptions`, `Application`, `BridgeDialString`)
use private fields + accessor methods. Pure data/DTO structs with
`#[non_exhaustive]` and constructors (`SofiaGateway`, `SofiaEndpoint`,
`SofiaContact`, `LoopbackEndpoint`, `UserEndpoint`, `SipCallInfoEntry`,
`ConferenceInfo` and its children) keep public fields — no validation
constraints on individual fields.

**Exception:** single-field error newtypes (`pub struct ParseFooError(pub String)`)
are exempt. These will never grow additional fields, and adding `#[non_exhaustive]`
would break destructuring (`let ParseFooError(msg) = err`) for zero practical
semver benefit.

Because `#[non_exhaustive]` prevents struct literal construction from external
crates (including `examples/`), every `#[non_exhaustive]` struct must have a
constructor (`new()` or named constructors). Optional fields use builder
methods (`with_foo()`). **Always run `cargo build --examples`** after adding
or modifying public structs to verify external construction still works.

## SIP Modules Are Protocol-Agnostic

Modules under the `sip_*` namespace (`sip_header`, `sip_header_addr`,
`SipCallInfo`) are pure SIP standard types with no FreeSWITCH coupling.
Doc comments, module-level docs, and error messages in these modules must
not reference FreeSWITCH, mod_sofia, ESL, NOTIFY_IN, or any FS-specific
concepts. FreeSWITCH integration context belongs in `lookup.rs` (the
`HeaderLookup` trait methods) or `variables/` (e.g. `SipInviteHeader`
for `sip_i_*` mappings).

## API Boundary Rules

- **Never expose dependency types in public signatures.** Return `impl Iterator`
  (not `indexmap::map::Iter`), wrap dependency errors (not `#[from] serde_json::Error`).
  A dependency major-version bump becomes a semver break if its types leak.
  **Exception:** `sip-uri` is an accepted public dependency of `freeswitch-types`
  (same author, narrow scope, stable). The `pub use sip_uri;` re-export and
  `SipHeaderAddr` returning `sip_uri::Uri` are intentional.
- **`pub(crate)` modules can still leak types.** If a public function returns a
  type from a `pub(crate)` module, that type is visible but unnameable by callers.
  Either re-export the type or don't return it.
- **Struct fields that control behavior should be private.** Expose via accessor
  methods (e.g. `scope()` not `pub vars_type`). This prevents callers from
  mutating invariants after construction.
- **`constants` module is `pub(crate)`.** Only `DEFAULT_ESL_PORT` is re-exported.
  Internal protocol constants are implementation details.

## Method Signature Conventions

- **`FromStr` casing rules.** Wire protocol types use **strict canonical case**.
  User-facing config types use `eq_ignore_ascii_case`. `Display` always emits
  the canonical form.
- **Typed + raw method pairs.** `filter()` / `filter_raw()`,
  `subscribe_events()` / `subscribe_events_raw()`. Always provide the `_raw`
  escape hatch for values not yet in the enum.
- **Options structs for optional wire headers.** Keep the base method simple;
  add `_with_options()` variant. Never grow parameter lists.
- **Preserve wire context in error/status enums.** Disconnect notices, auth
  responses carry useful context — never discard it.
- **Crate root re-exports: core and dptools only.** Module-specific types
  (conference, sofia) stay in their submodules.

- **`_mut()` accessors on serde command builders.** Structs that are both
  serde-deserializable and command builders (e.g. `Originate`, endpoint types)
  must pair each read accessor for an owned field (`&T`, `&Enum`) with a
  `_mut()` variant. Callers deserialize from config then need to tweak fields.

Follow existing patterns in the codebase for `impl Into<String>`, `Duration`,
`impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Borrow<T>>`, `HeaderLookup`, `From<Concrete>`.

## FreeSWITCH Sources

The FreeSWITCH C source tree is at `$FREESWITCH_SOURCE`. If the env var
is not set, ask the user for the path. Use it to verify wire protocol
behavior, event header handling, and SIP/ESL internals.

## Build & Test Workflow

**Always run `cargo fmt` before every commit.** The pre-commit hook enforces
formatting, clippy warnings, all tests (including doctests), `-D missing_docs`
doc coverage, and EslEventType sync with C ESL.

**When adding new `EslEventType` variants**, check whether they belong in any
of the event group constants (`CHANNEL_EVENTS`, `MEDIA_EVENTS`,
`PRESENCE_EVENTS`, `SYSTEM_EVENTS`, `CONFERENCE_EVENTS`) in
`freeswitch-types/src/event.rs` and update them accordingly.

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo check -p freeswitch-types --no-default-features --message-format=short
cargo check --workspace --message-format=short
cargo clippy --workspace --fix --allow-dirty --message-format=short
cargo test --workspace --lib
```

When FreeSWITCH ESL is available on `127.0.0.1:8022`, also run live tests:
`ss -tlnp sport = :8022` to check, then `cargo test --test live_freeswitch -- --ignored`.

## Release Workflow

This is a two-crate workspace. `freeswitch-esl-tokio` depends on
`freeswitch-types`, so **types must be published first**.

### Pre-release checks

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --release -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --release
cargo build --workspace --release
cargo build --examples
cargo semver-checks check-release -p freeswitch-types
cargo semver-checks check-release -p freeswitch-esl-tokio
cargo publish --dry-run -p freeswitch-types
```

### Publish order

```sh
cargo publish -p freeswitch-types
cargo publish -p freeswitch-esl-tokio
```

**Never `cargo publish` without completing these steps first:**

1. Create signed annotated tags (`git tag -as`)
2. Push the tags (`git push --tags`)
3. Wait for CI to pass on the tagged commit
4. Only then `cargo publish` (types first, then ESL)

## Documentation Style

All public items must have doc comments — the pre-commit hook enforces
`-D missing_docs`. Brief one-liners are fine for self-evident items.

No "captain obvious" docs. Don't restate the struct/function name as the doc comment.
Only document when it adds value: non-obvious behavior, FreeSWITCH-specific semantics,
wire format details, gotchas. Silence over noise. If the name and signature tell the
whole story, a brief one-liner suffices.

**No hardcoded counts in prose.** Don't write "26 variants" or "54 variables" in
markdown files or comments — these go stale when variants are added. Use dynamic
badges (CI-generated) in README or just omit the count.

## Logging and Credential Safety

Logged wire data must be accurate. Never use `.trim()` on wire content for
cosmetic reasons — it can eat meaningful whitespace. Strip only known protocol
suffixes by name (e.g. `strip_suffix(HEADER_TERMINATOR)`).

Types carrying secrets (passwords, auth tokens) need manual `Debug` impls
that redact sensitive fields. Wire logging uses `redact_wire()` to replace
passwords in `auth`/`userauth` commands. ESL sends passwords in cleartext
over TCP — debug logs in production must never expose them.

## Library Code Rules

**No `assert!`/`panic!`/`unwrap()` in library code** outside of tests. This is
a library crate — panics crash the caller's application. Return `Result` or
`Option` instead. The only exception is logic errors that truly cannot happen
(document why with a comment), and even then prefer `debug_assert!`.

**Wire security: validate user strings.** ESL is a text protocol where
`\n\n` terminates a command. Any user-provided string reaching the wire
without validation can inject arbitrary ESL commands. `to_wire_format()`
validates all user-supplied fields and rejects `\n`/`\r`. See
[docs/design-rationale.md](docs/design-rationale.md) for the full story.

## Correctness Over Recovery

Correctness is the highest priority. Never silently absorb protocol violations
or leave the system in an unknown state to "recover." If an invariant is broken
(e.g. missing mandatory header, impossible framing), return an error and let
the caller disconnect. A clean reconnection from a known-good state is always
preferable to continuing with a potentially corrupt stream.

Concretely: never use `unwrap_or` / default values to paper over missing
mandatory protocol fields. If the ESL spec says a field must be present,
its absence is a hard error — not a recoverable condition.

Never use `.parse().ok()` to silently discard parse errors on protocol
data. If a header is present but its value doesn't parse, that's a
protocol violation — return `Err`, don't collapse it into `None` where
it becomes indistinguishable from a missing header.

## Design Principles

See [docs/design-rationale.md](docs/design-rationale.md) for the full
motivation and production lessons behind these decisions.

- **No coupling to `EslEvent`**: accept closures or `HeaderLookup` trait,
  not `&EslEvent`. Callers store headers in `HashMap`, not `EslEvent`.
- **Transport only**: `EslClient` sends strings, returns `EslResponse`.
  No response parsing. Future wrapper crate owns typed command-and-response.
- **Command builders are `Display`/`FromStr`**: no transport dependency.
  Round-trip testable without a FreeSWITCH connection.
- **No automatic reconnection**: the library classifies errors
  (`is_connection_error()` / `is_recoverable()`), the caller decides
  what to do. `is_recoverable()` returns `false` for
  `AuthenticationFailed`, which serves the reconnect-loop prevention
  purpose.

## Outbound ESL Mode

See [docs/outbound-esl-quirks.md](docs/outbound-esl-quirks.md) for details.

- `connect_session()` must be the first command after `accept_outbound()`
- `async full` mode required for api/bgapi/linger/event commands
- Socket app args need quoting in originate — `Originate` builder handles this
  via `originate_quote()`/`originate_unquote()` in `commands/mod.rs`
- `cargo run --example outbound_test` exercises outbound against real FS on port 8022

## Examples — Write for the New User

Examples are the first thing a new user reads. Write them for someone who has
never used this library before.

- **Comment the "why", not the "what".** Explain non-obvious return types inline.
- **No em-dashes (—) in source code.** Fine in markdown prose.
- **Explain unwrap() calls** — if safe, say why in a comment.
- Examples use `ESL_HOST`/`ESL_PORT`/`ESL_PASSWORD` env vars with defaults.
- **Keep examples in sync** — build all examples after public API changes.
- **Use the typed API, not C ESL string patterns.** Use `HeaderLookup` trait,
  typed accessors, `EslEventType::Display`, `response.into_result()`. Never
  raw `header_str()` for headers with accessors, never `starts_with("+OK")`.
  LLMs default to the C ESL string-based pattern — review for this anti-pattern.

## Development Methodology — TDD

This project follows test-driven development:

1. Write failing tests that reproduce the bug or specify the new behavior
2. Confirm tests fail (`cargo test --lib`)
3. `cargo fmt && git commit --no-verify` (red phase — clippy/tests will fail, but code must be formatted)
4. Implement the fix/feature
5. Confirm all tests pass
6. Commit the implementation (hooks run normally)

### Test failures reveal bugs, not inconveniences

When a test fails against real FreeSWITCH, **assume the library has a bug**
until proven otherwise. Never work around a test failure by removing the
triggering input (e.g. dropping a timeout value, switching to a simpler
endpoint). If the library produces a command that FreeSWITCH rejects, the
serialization is wrong — fix the serializer, not the test.
