# Re-Exec Support for Zero-Downtime Binary Upgrades

## Overview

Long-running ESL daemons can upgrade their binary without dropping
the FreeSWITCH connection. The process receives a signal (e.g. SIGUSR2),
serializes application state, extracts the TCP socket file descriptor
from the library, and calls `exec()`. The new binary image restores
the connection using the preserved fd and any residual parser bytes.

## API

### Teardown (old process)

```rust
#[cfg(unix)]
let (fd, residual) = client.teardown_for_reexec().await?;
```

Returns the raw socket fd and any unparsed bytes remaining in the
parser buffer. After this call:

- The connection status is `Disconnected(ReexecTeardown)`.
- The caller must clear `CLOEXEC` on the fd before `exec()`.
- The caller must not drop the `EslClient` (or must `mem::forget` it)
  to keep the fd open through `exec()`.

### Adopt (new process)

```rust
let stream = unsafe { std::net::TcpStream::from_raw_fd(fd) };
stream.set_nonblocking(true)?;
let tokio_stream = tokio::net::TcpStream::from_std(stream)?;
let (client, events) = EslClient::adopt_stream(tokio_stream, &residual)?;
```

Creates a new `EslClient` from an already-authenticated TCP stream.
The parser is pre-seeded with any residual bytes from the previous
process.

## Drain Protocol

When `teardown_for_reexec()` is called, the reader loop must stop at
a clean message boundary. The ESL wire format is:

```
[headers]\n\n[body of Content-Length bytes]
```

Headers are consumed destructively by the parser. If we stopped while
the parser was mid-body (headers already consumed, waiting for body
bytes), the residual would be a partial body without its headers,
which is corrupt and unusable.

The drain logic handles this:

1. **Stop signal sent** to the reader loop via a oneshot channel.
2. **Reader checks parser state** after `parse_message()` returns `None`:
   - `WaitingForHeaders`: safe to stop. Residual bytes are a clean
     prefix of a new message. Send them back via the result channel.
   - `WaitingForBody`: keep reading from the socket (with a 5-second
     drain timeout) until the body completes. Dispatch the completed
     message normally, then stop at the next `WaitingForHeaders`.
3. **Drain timeout** (5s, `REEXEC_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS`): if the body
   never arrives, return `ReexecFailed` rather than hanging.

Messages completed during drain are dispatched normally to the event
channel, so the caller receives all in-flight events.

## Preconditions

- **No command in-flight.** If `pending_reply` is occupied (a command
  was sent but the reply hasn't arrived), teardown returns
  `ReexecFailed`. The caller must wait for commands to complete.
- **Single call.** Teardown takes the reexec channel from SharedState.
  Calling it twice returns `ReexecFailed`.

## Race Prevention

- **Liveness timeout** is disabled (set to 0) before sending the stop
  signal. Otherwise, if no traffic arrives between the signal and the
  reader processing it, the reader could exit with `HeartbeatExpired`
  and the result channel would never be sent.
- **Biased select** prioritizes the stop signal over socket reads, so
  the drain begins immediately when the signal fires.

## Event Subscriptions

FreeSWITCH maintains event subscriptions server-side on the TCP
connection. After `adopt_stream()`, events subscribed by the old
process arrive immediately without re-subscribing. The caller must
have their event loop ready before calling `adopt_stream()`, or
events buffered in the kernel's TCP receive buffer will queue up in
the library's event channel.

## Non-Goals

- **Preserving `EslEventStream` across exec.** The mpsc channel is
  process-local. The new process creates a fresh one via
  `adopt_stream()`.
- **Automatic reconnection.** The library detects disconnection; the
  caller controls reconnection strategy.
- **Cross-platform support.** `teardown_for_reexec()` is
  `#[cfg(unix)]` only. `adopt_stream()` works on all platforms (it
  just takes a `TcpStream`).

## Same-Process Testing Caveat

The `examples/reexec_demo.rs` simulates re-exec without actually
calling `exec()`. This introduces two issues that don't exist in
a real re-exec:

1. **Tokio reactor registration.** The old `EslClient` has the fd
   registered with the tokio epoll reactor. `from_raw_fd` on the
   same fd triggers Rust's I/O safety check (double ownership). In
   a real `exec()`, the epoll fd has `CLOEXEC` and is gone.

2. **TCP FIN on drop.** Dropping the `EslClient` drops the
   `OwnedWriteHalf`, which sends a TCP FIN. FreeSWITCH sees EOF
   and sends a disconnect notice. In a real `exec()`,
   `mem::forget(client)` prevents the Drop.

The demo works around both by calling `dup(fd)` to get a clean fd
unknown to the reactor, then `mem::forget(client)` to prevent the
TCP FIN. This leaks the old client's reactor registration (harmless
since the process exits shortly after).

## Usage Flow

```
SIGUSR2 received:
  // 1. Stop accepting new work
  // 2. Wait for pending commands to complete
  let (fd, residual) = client.teardown_for_reexec().await?;
  // 3. Serialize app state + residual to disk/env
  // 4. Clear CLOEXEC on fd
  nix::fcntl::fcntl(fd, nix::fcntl::FcntlArg::F_SETFD(nix::fcntl::FdFlag::empty()))?;
  // 5. mem::forget(client) to keep fd open
  std::mem::forget(client);
  // 6. exec()

New process starts:
  // 1. Read fd and residual from disk/env
  let stream = unsafe { std::net::TcpStream::from_raw_fd(fd) };
  stream.set_nonblocking(true)?;
  let tokio_stream = tokio::net::TcpStream::from_std(stream)?;
  // 2. Adopt the stream
  let (client, mut events) = EslClient::adopt_stream(tokio_stream, &residual)?;
  // 3. Restore app state
  // 4. Enter event loop
```
