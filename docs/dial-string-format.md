# FreeSWITCH Dial String Format

Reference for endpoint strings, variable scoping, and bridge semantics as they
appear on the ESL wire and in FreeSWITCH configuration. Based on FreeSWITCH
1.10.x source code (`switch_ivr_originate.c`, `mod_sofia.c`, `mod_loopback.c`,
`mod_dptools.c`). Line numbers index FreeSWITCH `v1.11.1`
(commit `c2c59645f6911a76589e5008c4d73349ded44b65`).

## Endpoint types

FreeSWITCH endpoints are **module-specific**. The core splits the dial string
on the first `/`, looks up the module name in an endpoint hash table
(`switch_loadable_module_get_endpoint_interface()`), and delegates all
remaining parsing to the module's `outgoing_channel` callback. There is no
universal endpoint grammar -- each module defines its own format.

### sofia (SIP)

Direct profile routing:

```
sofia/{profile}/{destination}
sofia/internal/1000@pbx.example.com
sofia/external/18005551234@carrier.example.com
```

Gateway routing (uses pre-configured gateway credentials and transport):

```
sofia/gateway/{gateway_name}/{destination}
sofia/gateway/my_provider/18005551234
```

Gateway with explicit profile qualifier:

```
sofia/gateway/{profile}::{gateway_name}/{destination}
sofia/gateway/internal::my_provider/18005551234
```

Source: `mod_sofia.c` -- checks if remainder starts with `gateway/`, then
parses as 3-part `gateway/name/dest`; otherwise parses as 2-part
`profile/dest` and formats the destination as a SIP URI.

### loopback

Re-enters the dialplan on a new channel pair. Useful for applying dialplan
logic to an originated call or for codec renegotiation.

```
loopback/{extension}[/{context}[/{dialplan}]]
loopback/9199
loopback/9199/default
loopback/9199/default/xml
loopback/app=lua:script.lua
```

Context defaults to `"default"`, dialplan defaults to `"xml"`.

Source: `mod_loopback.c` -- checks for `app=` prefix (direct application
execution), otherwise splits on `/` for extension/context/dialplan.

### user

Directory-based endpoint. Resolves via the user's `dial-string` parameter
in the FreeSWITCH directory XML. Typically expands to a `sofia_contact()`
expression.

```
user/{name}[@{domain}]
user/1000
user/bob@pbx.example.com
```

Common directory `dial-string` configuration:

```xml
<param name="dial-string"
  value="{^^:sip_invite_domain=${dialed_domain}:presence_id=${dialed_user}@${dialed_domain}}${sofia_contact(*/${dialed_user}@${dialed_domain})}"/>
```

### error

Pseudo-endpoint that terminates the call with a specific hangup cause.
Used in bridge dial strings for explicit failure routing.

```
error/{hangup_cause}
error/user_busy
error/user_not_registered
error/no_route_destination
```

### group

Directory-based group endpoint. Resolves to the `group_call()` API function
result.

```
group/{group_name}@{domain}
group/support@pbx.example.com
```

Equivalent to `${group_call(support@pbx.example.com)}`.

### portaudio / pulseaudio / alsa

Audio device endpoints for local sound hardware. The destination is optional
and typically `auto_answer` or a device identifier.

```
portaudio
portaudio/auto_answer
pulseaudio
pulseaudio/auto_answer
alsa
alsa/auto_answer
```

All three share the same `AudioEndpoint` struct in the library and differ
only in the module prefix.

## Variable scoping

Channel variables can be set on the B-leg (destination) of an originate or
bridge via bracket notation in the dial string. Three bracket types exist
with different scopes, listed in order of precedence (highest first):

### `[k=v]` -- channel (local) scope

Applies only to the **immediately following endpoint**. Highest precedence --
overrides global and enterprise variables.

```
[origination_caller_id_number=1234]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

Multiple blocks accumulate:

```
[var1=a][var2=b]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

Unlike `{}` and `<>`, a `[]` block is parsed after the dial string is split
into legs on `|` and then on `,`, and both splits run the same backslash-consuming
cleanup as the block parse. Three consequences, all measured:

- A literal backslash needs **thirty-two** backslashes here, not eight. At
  eight, `a\nb` arrives carrying a newline.
- A `|` in a value is read by the leg split, and the block becomes a leg with
  no endpoint (`CHAN_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`). `\|` carries it. The same goes for `|`
  as a `^^` separator, which `Variables` refuses in this scope. In `{}` and
  `<>`, parsed and removed before that split, a `|` is ordinary text.
- A value cannot carry a single quote. The scan that protects commas inside
  quotes during the leg split toggles on every `'` it meets, escaped or not, so
  two values each carrying one quote pair with each other and the first
  swallows the second: `[p1=it's,p2=don't,p3=x]` arrives as `p1=its,p2=dont`
  with no `p2` at all, at every escaping depth. `Variables` refuses such a
  value in channel scope.

### `{k=v}` -- default (global) scope

Applies to **all endpoints** in the current originate/bridge set. Multiple
blocks accumulate.

```
{hangup_after_bridge=true}sofia/gateway/gw/1234
{ignore_early_media=true}{call_timeout=30}sofia/gateway/gw/1234
```

### `<k=v>` -- enterprise (ultra-global) scope

Applies across **all threads** in an enterprise originate (`:_:` separated
sections). Lowest precedence.

```
<originate_timeout=60>{thread1_var=a}endpoint1:_:{thread2_var=b}endpoint2
```

### Combined example

```
<ultra_global=1>{thread_global=2}[per_endpoint=3]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

Effective variables on the channel: `ultra_global=1`, `thread_global=2`,
`per_endpoint=3`. If a key appears in multiple scopes, the narrower scope wins.

## Variable value escaping

How much escaping a value needs depends on **which command carries the block**,
because the switch escape-processes it a different number of times per carrier.
See [Parse depth](#parse-depth) below before relying on any of the forms here;
the rules in this section are what the `freeswitch-esl-tokio` crate emits, and
were measured against a live switch rather than derived from the source.

### Backslash escaping

A comma is escaped with a backslash, on either carrier:

```
{sip_h_Call-Info=<url>;meta=123\,<uri>}endpoint
```

A literal backslash needs **eight**, on either carrier. Fewer and the switch
reads the sequence as an escape and substitutes the character it names, so
`a\nb` arrives carrying a newline:

```
{path=C:\\\\\\\\Users}endpoint
```

A single quote is the one rule that differs by carrier — six backslashes
through a dialplan application, seven through the `originate` API:

```
{greeting=it\\\\\\'s_me}endpoint      <- dialplan: bridge, sendmsg execute
{greeting=it\\\\\\\'s_me}endpoint     <- api originate, bgapi originate
```

Each count leaves `\'` entering the carrier's last pass, which is what makes it
right: the parity differs because the dialplan carrier's first pass deletes a
`\'` outright while the API carrier's first pass keeps it. No count satisfies
both. Two and three also measure correctly on a block whose values carry one
quote each, and that is the trap — they deliver the quote bare to the last pass,
whose cleanup keeps a lone quote only while no other quote follows it in the
same field, so a value carrying two loses both. Test with two quoted values in
the block and two quotes in one value.

Values containing spaces are wrapped in single quotes. Those wrapping quotes are
balanced, so unlike a quote *inside* a value they behave identically on both
carriers:

```
{sip_h_X-Info='value with spaces'}endpoint
```

### Values that cannot be expressed at all

- **An empty value.** `{k=}` never reaches the channel: the switch splits the
  pair on `=`, requires exactly two fields, and `k=` yields one. The only
  `switch_log_printf` in that loop is inside the successful branch, so nothing
  is logged at any level. Quoting does not help — `k=''`, `k=\'\'` and
  `k=\\'\\'`, written raw into the block, were all measured discarded on both
  carriers.
- **A value closing a bracket it never opened.** `switch_find_end_paren` counts
  depth and honours no escape while doing so, so a lone `}`, `]` or `>` ends the
  block early and the remainder becomes dial-string text. A balanced pair such
  as `${var}` is fine and ordinary.

### The inline action list is a third carrier

Everything above concerns a `{k=v}` block. An inline action list —
`app:args,app:args` with the `inline` dialplan — is parsed by
`inline_dialplan_hunt` rather than by the block tokenizer, and its rules are its
own. All of the following were measured on a live switch.

**The separator is escaped, not chosen.** A bare comma inside an argument ends
the action, so the switch builds and runs applications nobody wrote and logs
nothing. One backslash is enough, because `cleanup_separated_string` unescapes a
character only when it is the delimiter of the split being cleaned up after: the
originate line is split on spaces first, where `\,` is left alone, then the
action list is split on its own separator, where the same `\,` becomes a comma.
`Originate::inline` emits this.

An `m:<delim>:` prefix immediately before the first action changes the separator
for the list, the way `^^` does for a block. It is consumed by the hunt, so
nothing of it survives into the extension — a masquerade onto another channel
carries the actions, never the prefix. `Originate::inline_with_delimiter` emits
it, and escapes the named separator the same way.

**One single quote arrives; a pair does not.** With the list wrapped in quotes —
which happens whenever any argument contains a space — a bare quote loses the
value entirely and `\'` delivers it. Unwrapped, both forms deliver it. A second
quote in the same value is read as closing a quoted region, so both are stripped
and the application receives the value with them missing:

```
set:v=a\'b with space     -> a'b with space
set:v=x\'a\'y with space  -> xay with space
```

No escape count avoids the second case; the characters are read as quoting
rather than as an escape sequence. This is what breaks a rendered
`${cond('${x}' != '' ? a : b)}`: `cond` receives no operands and returns `-ERR`
into the channel variable, which then rides out on the wire. `Originate::inline`
refuses an argument carrying more than one quote for that reason, and
`Originate::validate_inline` re-runs the check after a value has been
substituted into an argument.

### `^^X` block separator

Placed **immediately after the opening bracket**, `^^` and a replacement
character change the separator between pairs for the whole block, so values may
contain commas with no escaping:

```
{^^:sip_invite_domain=example.com:presence_id=bob@example.com}endpoint
{^^:codecs=PCMA,PCMU,G729:tenant=acme}endpoint
```

This is the only mechanism available when values arrive by `${...}` expansion,
because substitution happens *before* the block is parsed and no escaping can be
inserted into the result. It works identically on both carriers.

Only the comma changes. The block reaches the same tokenizer the same number of
times either way, so a literal backslash still needs eight and a single quote
still needs its per-carrier count: written raw in a `^^` block, `a\nb` arrives
carrying a newline, and a quote still turns off space splitting for the rest of
an `originate` line.

It does not help with a quoted value: the quote pairing suppresses splitting on
whichever separator is in use, so two quoted values still merge.

**A `^^X` prefix on an individual value is not a general mechanism.** Writing
`{k=^^:a:b}` sets `k` to the literal `^^:a:b` — measured on both carriers. Only
consumers that specifically decode it, such as the codec-string parser reading
`absolute_codec_string`, interpret the form; the bracket parser stores it
verbatim.

### Parse depth

`switch_event_create_brackets` tokenizes a block **twice on its own** — once
splitting the pairs on the separator, once splitting each pair on `=` — and both
calls run the full quote-stripping, backslash-consuming cleanup
(`cleanup_separated_string`) over their results. Each carrier adds one pass of
its own before those. Through the `originate` API it is `mod_commands` splitting
its argument list with `separate_string_blank_delim`, whose quote handling has
no lookahead: a quote opens a quoted region regardless of any delimiter. Through
a dialplan application it is variable expansion of the application's argument
(`switch_channel_expand_variables_check`), which consumes `\\` and deletes a `\'`
outright — both characters — and is skipped when `app_disable_expand_variables`
is true on the channel, which then leaves that carrier at the API's depth.

| Carrier | Passes |
|---|---|
| `bridge` and other dialplan applications, incl. `sendmsg execute` | expansion + 2 |
| `api originate`, `bgapi originate` | argv split + 2 |

Consequences worth knowing before hand-writing a block:

- An unescaped quote reaching the `originate` argv pass turns off space
  splitting for the rest of the line, so the command fails with a usage error
  rather than corrupting a value. That is the loud case.
- Two quotes that survive to the block parse pair with each other across the
  separator, so the pair between them is not split: the *first* value absorbs
  the second and the second is never set. The variable that goes missing is not
  the one that contained the quote.
- Two quotes that reach the last pass bare pair with each other inside the
  value, and both are stripped. The value stays otherwise intact, so a document
  that loses every apostrophe is still well-formed and nothing fails.
- A log line is not evidence either way. `mod_logfile` splits its own output
  with the same tokenizer, so a value is mangled in the log whether or not it
  was mangled on the wire. Read values back with `uuid_getvar` or `uuid_dump`.

## Keeping a value out of the tokenizer entirely

A large or free-text value — a PIDF-LO document for `sip_multipart`, say — has
no business crossing the block tokenizer at all: every apostrophe, comma,
backslash and space in it is a trap, and the block is line-delimited on the ESL
wire besides (`read_packet` in `mod_event_socket.c` takes the first line of the
packet as the command, so a newline never rides any `api` or `bgapi` command).
The switch offers one place where a value can be set on the new channel before
its INVITE is built, and it takes no value on the dial string.

`execute_on_originate` is a channel variable `switch_ivr_originate` reads off
the *new* channel after the bracket blocks have been installed on it and before
it launches that channel's session thread. `switch_channel_execute_on_value`
runs the named application synchronously on the originating thread (a `::`
between application and argument queues it instead — not what is wanted here).
mod_sofia sends the INVITE from `sofia_on_init`, on the session thread, so a
variable the hook sets is present when `sofia_glue_do_invite` reads
`sip_multipart`. Measured on a `sofia/` leg: the INVITE went out as
`multipart/mixed` carrying the document byte for byte, apostrophes and commas
intact, and the hook's `set` was logged before *sending invite*.

The dial string then carries paths and nothing else:

```
{execute_on_originate=lua /run/app/load_pidf.lua /run/app/<uuid>.xml}sofia/<profile>/<destination>
```

with the script reading the file and calling
`session:setVariable("sip_multipart", "application/pidf+xml:" .. body)`.
`CoreSession::setVariable` sets without the `${` check, so a document
containing that sequence is not refused. `process_mp` in `sofia_media.c` splits
the value at its first colon into content type and body, and
`sofia_media_get_multipart` wraps every `sip_multipart` value (the variable may
be stacked) and the SDP into one `multipart/mixed` body. The same is what an
inbound INVITE's parts look like on the far side, which
[`MultipartBody`](../freeswitch-types/src/variables/sip_multipart.rs) reads.

Things that bit while measuring it, each of which leaves the INVITE going out
*without* the part and one `ERR` line from mod_lua as the only trace:

- The application name is split from its argument at the first space or single
  colon. Keep the name bare and pass paths, never content: the argument is
  variable-expanded by `switch_core_session_exec` before the application sees
  it.
- The application must be flagged `SAF_SUPPORT_NOMEDIA`, or the media gate in
  `switch_core_session_execute_application_get_flags` refuses it on an outbound
  channel that has no media yet. `lua`, `set` and `export` are.
- The file is opened by FreeSWITCH, in FreeSWITCH's mount namespace, under
  FreeSWITCH's uid. A path that exists on the host and not in the service's
  namespace fails with *No such file or directory*, so a check that only
  inspects the host side proves nothing. Run the loader through the switch:
  the `lua` API runs a script on the calling thread and returns what it
  writes, whereas `luarun` spawns a thread and answers `+OK` unconditionally,
  so it cannot report a failure. That needs `lua` in the ESL user's
  `esl-allowed-api`.
- mod_lua's `io` read takes `"*a"`; `read("a")` is an invalid option there.

Carriers that looked like alternatives and are not:

- `sendmsg` with a `text/plain` body is genuinely length-delimited — the body
  becomes the application argument untouched (`switch_ivr_parse_event`) — but it
  addresses an existing session, and the value has to be on the channel before
  its INVITE exists.
- `global_setvar` splits its argument on `=` into three fields
  (`switch_separate_string`), so any value with an `=` in it is misread.
- A `user/` endpoint applies the directory user's `<variables>` to the new
  channel only after `switch_ivr_originate` has returned, which is after the
  INVITE; only `dial-var-*` params reach the variable event first. A directory
  served per call by mod_xml_curl is therefore a carrier, but a heavy one next
  to the hook.
- `\s` is a real escape (`unescape_char` maps `n`, `r`, `t` and `s`), and would
  spare a value the wrapping quotes, but the quote strip happens at the `=` pass
  regardless of spaces, so it fixes nothing on its own.

## Bridge separators

Bridge and originate dial strings support multiple endpoints with different
failure/concurrency semantics.

### `,` -- simultaneous ring (forked dialing)

All endpoints in a comma-separated group ring at the same time. The first
endpoint to **provide media** (answer or early media) wins; others stop
ringing.

```
sofia/internal/100@domain,sofia/internal/101@domain
```

Use `ignore_early_media=true` on the A-leg to prevent early media (ringback,
music) from prematurely selecting a winner -- common with cell phones.

### `|` -- sequential failover

Endpoints separated by pipe are tried **one at a time**, in order. The next
endpoint is tried only after the previous one fails.

```
sofia/gateway/primary/1234|sofia/gateway/secondary/1234|sofia/gateway/backup/1234
```

### `:_:` -- enterprise originate

Each `:_:`-separated section is originated in a **separate thread**.
Enterprise-scope `<>` variables apply across all threads. Each thread can
have its own `{}` global variables.

```
<originate_timeout=30>{thread1_cid=100}sofia/gw/a/1234:_:{thread2_cid=200}sofia/gw/b/1234
```

Constant: `SWITCH_ENT_ORIGINATE_DELIM = ":_:"` in `switch_types.h`.

### Combined example

```
{hangup_after_bridge=true}[t=10]sofia/gw/a/1234,[t=10]sofia/gw/b/1234|sofia/gw/backup/1234
```

Ring gateways `a` and `b` simultaneously (10s timeout each). If both fail,
try `backup` sequentially.

## Runtime expressions

FreeSWITCH supports `${}` variable expansion in dial strings. Some
expressions resolve to endpoint strings at call time.

### `sofia_contact`

Resolves the current registered SIP contact URI for a directory user. Returns
`error/user_not_registered` if no active registration.

```
${sofia_contact(user@domain)}
${sofia_contact(profile/user@domain)}
${sofia_contact(*/user@domain)}
```

The `*` searches all profiles. An optional `~user_agent` suffix filters by
User-Agent header.

Source: `sofia_contact_function` (`mod_sofia.c:4105-4236`).

### `group_call`

Resolves directory group members to a multi-endpoint dial string.

```
${group_call(group@domain)}
${group_call(group@domain+A)}
${group_call(group@domain+E)}
${group_call(group@domain+F)}
```

Flags: `A` = all (simultaneous), `E` = enterprise (`:_:` separated),
`F` = first match only.

### `eval` prefix (API evaluation)

Some applications evaluate an `eval` prefix by calling the FreeSWITCH API
first, then using the result as the dial string:

```
eval ${group_call(calltakers@${domain_name}+A)}
```

This is an application-level convention, not a core FreeSWITCH feature.

## Special bridge features

### `^` -- SIP To: header override

Appended after `@host` to override the To: header in the outbound SIP INVITE.
Useful for number portability routing where the Request-URI needs extra
parameters but the To: header should contain the clean number.

```
sip:12135551212;rn=12135550000;npdi=yes@1.2.3.4:5060^12135551212
```

### Bridge control variables

Common variables that affect bridge behavior (set on the A-leg before bridge):

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `call_timeout` | Seconds to wait for answer |
| `originate_timeout` | Per-endpoint timeout in originate |
| `hangup_after_bridge` | Hang up A-leg after B-leg disconnects |
| `bypass_media` | SDP passthrough (RTP flows directly between endpoints) |
| `ignore_early_media` | Don't select winner on early media (183/180+SDP) |
| `ringback` | Play tone/file to A-leg during ringing |
| `transfer_ringback` | Play during attended transfer |
| `fail_on_single_reject` | Fail entire bridge if any endpoint rejects |
| `hangup_on_single_reject` | Hang up if any endpoint rejects |
| `continue_on_fail` | Continue dialplan after bridge failure |
| `bridge_early_media` | Bridge early media to A-leg |

## Wire format in ESL

When constructing dial strings via ESL (`api originate`, `bgapi originate`,
`sendmsg execute bridge`), the complete format is:

```
originate <[vars]endpoint> <app> [dialplan] [context] [cid_name] [cid_num] [timeout]
```

For bridge (via sendmsg):

```
execute bridge <[vars]endpoint[,endpoint][|endpoint]>
```

Application arguments containing spaces must be single-quoted in originate:

```
originate loopback/9199/test '&socket(127.0.0.1:8040 async full)'
```

The `freeswitch-esl-tokio` library handles this quoting automatically via
`originate_quote()` / `originate_unquote()`.

These two lines are the two carriers of [Parse depth](#parse-depth), and the
typed API picks the right escaping for each without being told: `Originate`
renders for the API carrier, `BridgeDialString` for the dialplan one. `Display`
on a bare `Variables` or `Endpoint` means the API carrier, because that is what
this crate mostly drives — so a block rendered on its own and spliced into a
dialplan string by hand is the one case that needs
`display_for(DialStringCarrier::Dialplan)` and will otherwise be escaped one
level too deep.
