# FreeSWITCH Dial String Format

Reference for endpoint strings, variable scoping, and bridge semantics as they
appear on the ESL wire and in FreeSWITCH configuration. Based on FreeSWITCH
1.10.x source code (`switch_ivr_originate.c`, `mod_sofia.c`, `mod_loopback.c`,
`mod_dptools.c`).

## Endpoint types

FreeSWITCH endpoints are **module-specific**. The core splits the dial string
on the first `/`, looks up the module name in an endpoint hash table
(`switch_loadable_module_get_endpoint_interface()`), and delegates all
remaining parsing to the module's `outgoing_channel` callback. There is no
universal endpoint grammar -- each module defines its own format.

### sofia (SIP)

Direct profile routing:

```
sofia/{profile}/{destination}
sofia/internal/1000@pbx.example.com
sofia/external/18005551234@carrier.example.com
```

Gateway routing (uses pre-configured gateway credentials and transport):

```
sofia/gateway/{gateway_name}/{destination}
sofia/gateway/my_provider/18005551234
```

Gateway with explicit profile qualifier:

```
sofia/gateway/{profile}::{gateway_name}/{destination}
sofia/gateway/internal::my_provider/18005551234
```

Source: `mod_sofia.c` -- checks if remainder starts with `gateway/`, then
parses as 3-part `gateway/name/dest`; otherwise parses as 2-part
`profile/dest` and formats the destination as a SIP URI.

### loopback

Re-enters the dialplan on a new channel pair. Useful for applying dialplan
logic to an originated call or for codec renegotiation.

```
loopback/{extension}[/{context}[/{dialplan}]]
loopback/9199
loopback/9199/default
loopback/9199/default/xml
loopback/app=lua:script.lua
```

Context defaults to `"default"`, dialplan defaults to `"xml"`.

Source: `mod_loopback.c` -- checks for `app=` prefix (direct application
execution), otherwise splits on `/` for extension/context/dialplan.

### user

Directory-based endpoint. Resolves via the user's `dial-string` parameter
in the FreeSWITCH directory XML. Typically expands to a `sofia_contact()`
expression.

```
user/{name}[@{domain}]
user/1000
user/bob@pbx.example.com
```

Common directory `dial-string` configuration:

```xml
<param name="dial-string"
  value="{^^:sip_invite_domain=${dialed_domain}:presence_id=${dialed_user}@${dialed_domain}}${sofia_contact(*/${dialed_user}@${dialed_domain})}"/>
```

### error

Pseudo-endpoint that terminates the call with a specific hangup cause.
Used in bridge dial strings for explicit failure routing.

```
error/{hangup_cause}
error/user_busy
error/user_not_registered
error/no_route_destination
```

### group

Directory-based group endpoint. Resolves to the `group_call()` API function
result.

```
group/{group_name}@{domain}
group/support@pbx.example.com
```

Equivalent to `${group_call(support@pbx.example.com)}`.

## Variable scoping

Channel variables can be set on the B-leg (destination) of an originate or
bridge via bracket notation in the dial string. Three bracket types exist
with different scopes, listed in order of precedence (highest first):

### `[k=v]` -- channel (local) scope

Applies only to the **immediately following endpoint**. Highest precedence --
overrides global and enterprise variables.

```
[origination_caller_id_number=1234]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

Multiple blocks accumulate:

```
[var1=a][var2=b]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

### `{k=v}` -- default (global) scope

Applies to **all endpoints** in the current originate/bridge set. Multiple
blocks accumulate.

```
{hangup_after_bridge=true}sofia/gateway/gw/1234
{ignore_early_media=true}{call_timeout=30}sofia/gateway/gw/1234
```

### `<k=v>` -- enterprise (ultra-global) scope

Applies across **all threads** in an enterprise originate (`:_:` separated
sections). Lowest precedence.

```
<originate_timeout=60>{thread1_var=a}endpoint1:_:{thread2_var=b}endpoint2
```

### Combined example

```
<ultra_global=1>{thread_global=2}[per_endpoint=3]sofia/internal/1000@domain
```

Effective variables on the channel: `ultra_global=1`, `thread_global=2`,
`per_endpoint=3`. If a key appears in multiple scopes, the narrower scope wins.

## Variable value escaping

Variable values in bracket notation need escaping when they contain special
characters.

### Backslash escaping

Commas and single quotes are escaped with backslash:

```
{sip_h_Call-Info=<url>;meta=123\,<uri>}endpoint
{greeting=it\'s_me}endpoint
```

Values containing spaces are wrapped in single quotes:

```
{sip_h_X-Info='value with spaces'}endpoint
```

### `^^X` custom delimiter

Alternative to backslash-escaping for values containing commas. The value
starts with `^^` followed by a replacement character. FreeSWITCH converts
the replacement character back to commas when setting the channel variable.

```
{absolute_codec_string=^^:PCMA@8000h@20i:PCMU@8000h@20i:G729@8000h@20i}endpoint
```

Here `:` replaces `,` in the codec list. The channel variable is set to
`PCMA@8000h@20i,PCMU@8000h@20i,G729@8000h@20i`.

Also supported inside brackets: `[^^var=val]`.

### Bracket-level `^^:` delimiter

When used at the **block level** (as the first element after the opening
bracket), changes the delimiter between key=value pairs for the entire block:

```
{^^:sip_invite_domain=example.com:presence_id=bob@example.com}endpoint
```

Here `:` separates variables instead of `,`.

## Bridge separators

Bridge and originate dial strings support multiple endpoints with different
failure/concurrency semantics.

### `,` -- simultaneous ring (forked dialing)

All endpoints in a comma-separated group ring at the same time. The first
endpoint to **provide media** (answer or early media) wins; others stop
ringing.

```
sofia/internal/100@domain,sofia/internal/101@domain
```

Use `ignore_early_media=true` on the A-leg to prevent early media (ringback,
music) from prematurely selecting a winner -- common with cell phones.

### `|` -- sequential failover

Endpoints separated by pipe are tried **one at a time**, in order. The next
endpoint is tried only after the previous one fails.

```
sofia/gateway/primary/1234|sofia/gateway/secondary/1234|sofia/gateway/backup/1234
```

### `:_:` -- enterprise originate

Each `:_:`-separated section is originated in a **separate thread**.
Enterprise-scope `<>` variables apply across all threads. Each thread can
have its own `{}` global variables.

```
<originate_timeout=30>{thread1_cid=100}sofia/gw/a/1234:_:{thread2_cid=200}sofia/gw/b/1234
```

Constant: `SWITCH_ENT_ORIGINATE_DELIM = ":_:"` in `switch_types.h`.

### Combined example

```
{hangup_after_bridge=true}[t=10]sofia/gw/a/1234,[t=10]sofia/gw/b/1234|sofia/gw/backup/1234
```

Ring gateways `a` and `b` simultaneously (10s timeout each). If both fail,
try `backup` sequentially.

## Runtime expressions

FreeSWITCH supports `${}` variable expansion in dial strings. Some
expressions resolve to endpoint strings at call time.

### `sofia_contact`

Resolves the current registered SIP contact URI for a directory user. Returns
`error/user_not_registered` if no active registration.

```
${sofia_contact(user@domain)}
${sofia_contact(profile/user@domain)}
${sofia_contact(*/user@domain)}
```

The `*` searches all profiles. An optional `~user_agent` suffix filters by
User-Agent header.

Source: `mod_sofia.c` lines 4400-4531.

### `group_call`

Resolves directory group members to a multi-endpoint dial string.

```
${group_call(group@domain)}
${group_call(group@domain+A)}
${group_call(group@domain+E)}
${group_call(group@domain+F)}
```

Flags: `A` = all (simultaneous), `E` = enterprise (`:_:` separated),
`F` = first match only.

### `eval` prefix (API evaluation)

Some applications evaluate an `eval` prefix by calling the FreeSWITCH API
first, then using the result as the dial string:

```
eval ${group_call(calltakers@${domain_name}+A)}
```

This is an application-level convention, not a core FreeSWITCH feature.

## Special bridge features

### `^` -- SIP To: header override

Appended after `@host` to override the To: header in the outbound SIP INVITE.
Useful for number portability routing where the Request-URI needs extra
parameters but the To: header should contain the clean number.

```
sip:12135551212;rn=12135550000;npdi=yes@1.2.3.4:5060^12135551212
```

### Bridge control variables

Common variables that affect bridge behavior (set on the A-leg before bridge):

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `call_timeout` | Seconds to wait for answer |
| `originate_timeout` | Per-endpoint timeout in originate |
| `hangup_after_bridge` | Hang up A-leg after B-leg disconnects |
| `bypass_media` | SDP passthrough (RTP flows directly between endpoints) |
| `ignore_early_media` | Don't select winner on early media (183/180+SDP) |
| `ringback` | Play tone/file to A-leg during ringing |
| `transfer_ringback` | Play during attended transfer |
| `fail_on_single_reject` | Fail entire bridge if any endpoint rejects |
| `hangup_on_single_reject` | Hang up if any endpoint rejects |
| `continue_on_fail` | Continue dialplan after bridge failure |
| `bridge_early_media` | Bridge early media to A-leg |

## Wire format in ESL

When constructing dial strings via ESL (`api originate`, `bgapi originate`,
`sendmsg execute bridge`), the complete format is:

```
originate <[vars]endpoint> <app> [dialplan] [context] [cid_name] [cid_num] [timeout]
```

For bridge (via sendmsg):

```
execute bridge <[vars]endpoint[,endpoint][|endpoint]>
```

Application arguments containing spaces must be single-quoted in originate:

```
originate loopback/9199/test '&socket(127.0.0.1:8040 async full)'
```

The `freeswitch-esl-tokio` library handles this quoting automatically via
`originate_quote()` / `originate_unquote()`.
