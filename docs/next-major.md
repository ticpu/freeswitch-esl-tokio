# Deferred to the next major

Changes that are right but cannot ship under the current major. Read this when
bumping `freeswitch-types` to 2.0 or `freeswitch-esl-tokio` to 3.0, and delete
each entry as it lands.

Every entry names a symbol. If the symbol is gone, the entry is stale — remove
it rather than guess what it meant. Nothing here is a promise; a decision may be
revisited when it is finally actionable.

## freeswitch-types 2.0

### `AudioEndpoint::fmt_with_prefix` should be private

It takes a `&mut fmt::Formatter`, which a caller can only obtain inside a
`Display` impl, and nothing outside the module calls it. It stays public only
because it shipped in 1.4.0; the carrier-aware `write_with_prefix` beside it is
already `pub(super)`. Make the public one private and drop the duplicate.

### `DialString: fmt::Display` forces an invalid endpoint string

The supertrait bound obliges `AudioEndpoint` to have a `Display` impl, and that
impl has no module prefix to render, so it emits `audio` — not a FreeSWITCH
endpoint. Its own rustdoc warns against calling it. Either drop the `Display`
bound from `DialString`, or drop the impl and let the three `Endpoint` variants
be the only way to render an audio endpoint.

### `Variables::insert` and `with_vars` need to be fallible

Some values cannot be represented in a bracket block at all: an empty value is
discarded by the switch under every encoding, and a value carrying an unbalanced
closing bracket truncates the block. A value carrying the block's own `^^`
separator is the third: `with_separator` checks the values present when it is
called, and an `insert` after it splits into a pair nobody wrote. A single quote
in a channel-scope value is the fourth: the switch pairs it with the next quote
before it parses the block, at any escaping depth.
Refusing them is the only correct handling,
and it cannot live at render time — `Display` is infallible and `ToString`
panics on a `fmt::Error`, which would put a panic in a library. Until these
return `Result`, such a value is built silently and lost on the wire.

`Deserialize` and `FromStr` already return `Result`, so they can reject at the
boundary without waiting for the major — that covers config-driven construction
but not the programmatic path.

### Consider removing `Display` for `Variables` and `Endpoint`

Both render for `DialStringCarrier::EslApi`, which is right for what this crate
mostly drives but silently wrong for a block hand-spliced into a dialplan
string. Removing the impls would force `display_for(carrier)` at every call
site, making a wrong carrier unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely. The
cost is ergonomic and it breaks `format!("{vars}")` everywhere, so it is worth
weighing against how often the default is actually wrong in practice.


## freeswitch-esl-tokio 3.0

### `subscribe_events_raw` and `nixevent_raw` should return what they swallowed

Both send their token list verbatim, and `CUSTOM` is terminal, so an event type
placed after it is registered as a subclass name and never subscribed — with
`+OK` on the wire and nothing in the reply to say so. `swallowed_event_types`
detects that case today, but only for a caller who already knows to ask.

Returning it instead of `()`, behind a `#[must_use]` carrier, puts the warning
in front of a caller who does not: existing `.await?;` call sites keep
compiling and start warning. It waits for the major because changing the `Ok`
type is a break, not because the diagnostic is optional.

### It inherits whatever `freeswitch-types` 2.0 breaks

The types above are re-exported from the crate root, so any change to their
public surface breaks this crate's too. There is no separate work item — the
bump is the work. Sequence the release accordingly: `freeswitch-types` 2.0
publishes first, then this crate.

### `EslHeaders::parse_uri_info` and `parse_history_info` flatten the ARRAY error

Both map an `EslArrayError` into `UriInfoError::Malformed(String)` /
`HistoryInfoError::Malformed(String)`, so a caller cannot tell a cap breach
from a malformed URI without matching message text, and the source chain is
gone. The fix is an `EslHeaders`-owned error wrapping both, which changes the
return type.

### `SipPassthroughHeader::is_array_header` answers `false` for unknown headers

An unknown header name is neither single- nor multi-valued; `bool` cannot say
so, and a custom `X-*` header carrying a comma list is reported single-valued.
Return `Option<bool>`.

### `UuidHold.off: bool` should be `HoldAction`

`ConferenceHold` spells hold-versus-unhold with the `HoldAction` wire enum;
`UuidHold` spells it with a bare bool. Reuse the enum.

### `EventFormat::from_str` is case-insensitive on a wire token

The value goes on the wire in `event <format> ...`, so under the FromStr casing
rule it should be strict canonical like every other `wire_enum!`. Tightening
rejects input it accepts today.

### `Originate` uses three mutation vocabularies

`name_mut`/`args_mut`, five `set_*` for `Option` fields, and
`endpoint_mut`/`target_mut` on one builder; readers `dialplan_type`,
`context_str`, `caller_id_name` do not match builders `dialplan`, `context`,
`cid_name`. Pick `_mut()` pairs and one field vocabulary; add `Variables::get_mut`
with it. The `set_*` methods take `Option<impl Into<String>>`, so clearing a field
needs a turbofish (`set_context(None::<String>)`); the replacement takes a
concrete `Option` or offers `clear_*`.

### `EventSubscription::custom_subclass_list` should be `custom_subclasses`

Every other pair on the type is `x()`/`x_mut()`; this reader is the odd one.

### `InvalidHeaderName` should follow the `Parse*Error` / `*Error` naming

Its siblings `ParseSipPassthroughError` and `EslArrayError` set the two
conventions; this one follows neither.

### `parse_originate_target` should be `pub(crate)`

Public, re-exported nowhere, one caller inside `Originate::from_str`.


### `FilterDelete { header: "all" }` duplicates `FilterDeleteAll`

Both emit the same wire; the first warns at runtime that its `value` is
ignored. Reject `"all"` in `FilterDelete` or drop the special case.

### `getvar` should be `getvar_raw`

Its `Ok` may be the `-ERR`-shaped filler the switch returns for an unset
variable; `getvar_opt` is the honest accessor and wants the plain name.

### `AppCommand::transfer` takes two positional `Option`s

`transfer(extension, Option<DialplanType>, Option<&str>)` documents the
interaction of its options instead of typing it. An options struct or named
variants.

### `EslError::ReexecFailed`, `JsonError`, `XmlError` carry no source

Each stringifies the underlying error into a `String` field. Boxed `#[source]`
fields keep the dependency types out of the signature and restore the chain;
changing the field types is the break.

### `impl futures_util::Stream for EslEventStream` puts futures-util in the public API

A futures-util major becomes a semver break for this crate. Move behind a
feature, or wait for `Stream` in std.
